# Description

On-chain poker represents a fascinating application of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) in the gaming domain. Chainbluff's on-chain poker concept works like this:

## Card Privacy with FHE: 
In traditional poker games, players keep their cards private until the end of the round. On-chain poker takes this concept further by using FHE to encrypt the cards during the entire round. Each player's hand is encrypted in a way that allows computations to be performed on the encrypted data without revealing the actual cards.

## Secure Gameplay: 
With FHE, the entire process of playing the game, from receiving and holding cards to making bets, can occur with encrypted data. This ensures that no player or external party can gain access to the content of another player's hand during the round.

## Encrypted Computation of Bets and Actions: 
The use of FHE allows the secure computation of bets and game actions without the need to decrypt the card information. The encrypted cards can be used in various game-related computations, such as determining the strength of a hand, calculating bets, and managing the overall game logic.

## End-of-Round Card Revelation: 
At the end of the poker round, FHE can be leveraged to reveal and compare the encrypted cards. Only then are the cards decrypted, allowing players to see each other's hands. This adds an extra layer of suspense and privacy throughout the game.

## Enhanced Player Privacy: 
On-chain poker with FHE addresses concerns related to player privacy. The encryption of cards ensures that individual players maintain confidentiality, reducing the risk of cheating or unfair play.

## Trust in the Decentralized Environment: 
If the on-chain poker game is built on a decentralized blockchain platform, players can have increased trust in the fairness of the game. The decentralized nature of the blockchain, combined with FHE, contributes to a transparent and secure gaming environment.
